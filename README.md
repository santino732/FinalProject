# FinalProject
Probability and Statistics Final Project 2022

Octave -> Do a tutorial, put results in a document reporting what you learned.  
          Use Octave to plot a function, salt data, smooth data.  
          They're mostly pictures, but give some captions and some English words.  2mins (pictures included).

SalterSmoother -> Let's write a program, it will plot a function,salted data, smoothed data.
                  But this time, I'd like you to use someone elses library. 
                  For graphing, I'd like you to use Jfreecharts.  ie import zzz.zzz.JFreeCharts
                  For smoothing, I'd like you to use apaches stats library.
                  Write a mini reports showing results. 2 pages (pictures included).

PokerSimulation -> 

StatsLibrary -> Turn in a copy of your stats library.  Variance solver, STD solver, Permuations Combinations solver.  Mean median mode.If possible, do as                   many stats library formula solves as you can.


Formula.Sheet.pdf -> Turn in a word document with all of the Stats Formulas that we've used so far.

MiniReportChapter4.docx -> Mini write up on the last distributions of chapter 4.  Normal, Beta, and Gamma Distibutions. 2 page.

DataSetAnalysis.docx -> Go online and find a dataset that you like.  We're going use the data set to as the  base to solve problems from the text. ie Make up, and solve stats problems.  Use book as a guide. Atleast one example from every section.
